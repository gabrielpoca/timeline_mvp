# Timeline

Timeline is a note-taking application for the unorganised. I built it because I couldn't find anything that fits my needs. The idea is pretty simple. You write everything on it and then powerfull searching gets you want you're looking for. Anything goes: text, images, PDFs, etc.

> ⚠️ This is a prototype I build for myself to validate my idea. I wrote it in VueJS because I needed to keep things interesting. I'm now rewriting it in React because that's the framework I've been using these past 5 years. Vue was refreshing, I truly enjoyed it, but unfortunally I don't have enough energy to keep it going.
